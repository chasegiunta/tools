Tools for your Craft website.

## Field types

### Ancestors
An Entries input that only shows the ancestors of the current Entry.

### Entries Search
Like the Tags input, but for Entries (without the auto-creation feature).

### Disabled Fields
The same as regular fields, but disabled. Useful for situations where you want to integrate with a third party API and store that information in a field but donâ€™t want the user to change it.

The following field types are currently supported:

- Categories
- Lightswitch
- Number
- PlainText
- Dropdown


## Miscellaneous

### Download File
A controller action that will force download a file.

The `id` parameter is required and must be a valid Asset id.

Usage:
```
<a href="{{ actionUrl('supercoolTools/downloadFile', { id : file.id }) }}">Download</a>
```


# Roadmap

- Release notes widget / dashboard integration
